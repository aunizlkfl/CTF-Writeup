## Challenge

A tiny RPG Maker maze game. We do not need to finish the maze; the flag is somewhere in the game data. Because itâ€™s MV, all maps and event dialogs live in www/data/Map*.json.

## Solution

Unpack nw_100_percent.zip and looked in www/data.

In www/data/Map001.json, event ID 18 at (x=26, y=11) shows a text line that literally contains the flag

## Flag
```
GCTF25{7r4n5l470r_w0rk_h4rd}
```
