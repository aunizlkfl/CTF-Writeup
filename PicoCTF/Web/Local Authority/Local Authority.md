## 🛠️ Steps to Solve

### 1️⃣ Initial Login Attempt
We were given a **login page** of a *Secure Customer Portal*.  
So let’s try a default username and password: **admin : admin**

### 3️⃣ Inspecting the Code 🔍
By opening **Developer Tools → Network**, we saw several files being loaded:  
- `login.php`  
- `style.css`  
- `secure.js`  

So we inspected the source of each file. Inside **secure.js**, we found the following script:

```javascript
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```
### 4️⃣ Discovering the Credentials 🔑
From the script, the correct login is clearly:  
- **Username:** `admin`  
- **Password:** `strongPassword098765`

---

### 5️⃣ Successful Login 🎉
We tried the credentials:  
- Username: **admin**  
- Password: **strongPassword098765**

And we successfully logged in!
